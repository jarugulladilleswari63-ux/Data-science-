# Data-analysis 
Performed Python-based weather data analysis with data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations to uncover key temperature and seasonal climate patterns.

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical weather data to uncover trends in temperature, humidity, rainfall, and seasonal patterns. Using Python-based data analysis techniques, the goal is to transform raw weather records into meaningful insights that help understand climate behavior over time.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas – data cleaning & manipulation
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualizations
IDLE

🔍 Key Steps in the Analysis :
1️⃣ Data Cleaning
Handled missing values
Removed duplicates
Standardized date formats
Converted columns to appropriate data types

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution analysis of temperature, humidity, rainfall
Trend analysis across months and seasons
Identification of extreme weather conditions
Correlation mapping between parameters

3️⃣ Data Visualization
Created clear visual charts to understand:
Daily, monthly & yearly temperature changes
Seasonal rainfall patterns
Humidity variation
Heatmaps for correlation

📈 Insights & Findings
Temperature follows a clear seasonal trend with noticeable peaks and drops.
Humidity levels are strongly linked to rainfall and seasonal shifts.
Certain months show higher rainfall concentration, indicating monsoon impact.
Correlation analysis reveals relationships between temperature, humidity, and pressure.
